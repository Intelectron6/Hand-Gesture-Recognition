# Hand-Gesture-Recognition

This project implements image based hand gesture recognition using deep learning. 4 gestures are recognized - 1) Fist, 2) One, 3) Palm, 4) Peace. </br>

Neural_Network.ipynb can be run on Google Colab, hence it has no dependencies. Dataset must be uploaded on Google Drive first. </br>
Gesture_Recognition.py has to be run on a computer with a webcamera. The weight and bias csv files generated by Neural_Network.ipynb must be present in the same directory as Gesture_Recognition.py. Dependencies are NumPy, OpenCV (cv2) and Pandas. </br>

Note that to extract the hand, background subtraction has been used. Hence, the background must be same throughout in order for this to work.
